/**
 * Instructions:
 * First, consider the different ways we could keep a collection of students.
 * Initialize five Student variables as Student1, Student2, etc. What would 
 * you use if you had twenty students? What would you use if you didn't know
 * how many students you would have? How would you initialize the students? 
 * Answer these questions below.
 * ANSWER HERE:
 * 
 * Give the course an instructor of type Professor, an array of Students, and 
 * a String room number, along with any other instance variables you find 
 * appropriate.
 * Create getter and setter methods for these variables.
 * Create a constructor for the class. In it, assign the student array to an
 * array of size 5, and initialize Student objects within it.
 * Create a getStudentsByYear(int year) method that returns the students that 
 * have that class year, using the class year attribute of the Student class.
 * Create a getClassAvg() method that calculates and returns the average 
 * grade of all students in the class, using the getClassGrade() method
 * you wrote in the Student class.
 * 
 * Finally, add Javadoc to your methods, a description of the class, and
 * author and version tags. You may delete these instructions if you wish.
 * 
 * Write a description of class CS111 here.
 *
 * @author CS200 Instructors
