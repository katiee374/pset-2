# PSET 1:
## Part 1: Modeling Wellesley's CS111 Class
  In this first task of the assignment, you will employ object-oriented programming principles to model a section of CS 111. You will create student and professor classes to represent students and professors, and provide methods that will allow you to get statistics about the class.
Goals:
* Practice with OOP principles to create a simple object-oriented programming structure.
* Practice quantitative reasoning and mathematical skills through creating QR-based instance methods.
* Declare variables and create instances of classes.

It is recommended that you move through the assignment in the following order:
1. The Professor class.
2. The Student class.
3. The CS111 class.

## Part 2: Designing Yahtzee
  In the second half of this assignment, you will complete the code we have provided for you to implement the game Yahtzee. If you don't know what that is, read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee). Later in the semester, we will create more exciting programs using GUI (graphic user interfaces), but for now this game will simply rely on text output to the terminal. You will create a Dice class that models rolling a dice, and fill in the Yahtzee class to communicate with the Scorecard class and print output to the terminal. At the end, you will be able to play your Yahtzee game with your friends and family.
Goals:
* Create an interesting program that you can run and interact with.
* Practice OOP principles through implementing class methods and constructors.
* Understand the breakdown of complex programs into manageable parts as individual  classes.

It is recommended that you move through the assignment in the following order:
1. The Dice class.
2. The Scorecard class.
3. The Game class.
