# PSET 2
## Part 1: Modeling Wellesley's CS111 Class
In the first task of the assignment, you will employ object-oriented 
programming principles to model a section of CS 111. You will create student 
and professor classes to represent students and professors, and provide 
methods that will allow you to get statistics about the class.

Goals:
* Practice with OOP principles to create a simple object-oriented programming 
 structure.
* Practice quantitative reasoning and mathematical skills through creating 
 QR-based instance methods.
* Declare variables and create instances of classes.

It is recommended that you move through the assignment in the following order:
1. The Professor class.
2. The Student class.
3. The CS111 class.

## Part 2: Designing Your Own Adventure Game
In the second half of this assignment, you will create your own text-based Adventure game. Later in the class, you will learn to use graphical user interfaces (GUI) to create more visually appealing programs. For now, we'd like you to unleash your creativity in a text-based way. You can set the theme of your adventure game, though we've provided a few suggestions, and add whatever additional functionality you'd like. Have fun!

Goals:
* Create an interesting program that you can run and interact with.
* Practice OOP principles through implementing class methods and constructors.
* Understand the breakdown of complex programs into manageable parts as individual  classes.
