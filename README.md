# PSET 1:
## Part 1: Modeling Wellesley's CS111 Class
  In this first task of the assignment, you will employ object-oriented programming principles to model a section of CS 111. You will create student and professor classes to represent students and professors, and provide methods that will allow you to get statistics about the class.
Goals:
* Practice with OOP principles to create a simple object-oriented programming structure.
* Practice quantitative reasoning and mathematical skills through creating QR-based instance methods.
* Declare variables and create instances of classes.

It is recommended that you move through the assignment in the following order:
1. The Professor class
2. The Student class
3. The CS111 class
