/**
 * Instructions:
 * Give the student a name, class year, project grade, midterm grade, and 
 * final grade. Choose the data types carefully.
 * Create getter and setter methods for these variables.
 * Create a constructor for the class that gives every variable a value.
 * Create a getClassGrade() method that calculates and returns their 
 * class grade according to the grading policy: the final is worth 50%, the 
 * midterm is worth 25%, and the project is worth 25%.
 * 
 * Finally, add Javadoc to your methods, a description of the class, and
 * author and version tags. You may delete these instructions if you wish.
 * 
 * Write a description of class Student here.
