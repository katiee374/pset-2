Instructions:
Add the following to your Game.java file:
 * An ArrayList directions containing the Strings "North", "South", "East", 
   "West"
 * An ArrayList of Room objects named Blueprint
 * An Actor object named Player

Then, write the method moveTo(Actor a, int direction) to do the following:
 * Initialize int exit.
 * Initialize Room room to a.getLocation().
 * Check if direction is between zero and 3 (representing the values N, S, E, W
   respectively)
       If so: Set Exit to be room.getN/S/E/W() depending on the value of 
       direction
 * If, at the end of these checks, exit is NOT -1, set the actor location to 
   exit, and print where the actor is moving to (by retrieving the room from 
   Blueprint).
 * Else, print "No exit"

Next, update the parsing of user commands:
 * In Game.java, add the commands n, s, e, w to your parseCommand method's 
   ArrayList of commands.
 * Move the ArrayLists of commands and objects to be an instance variable of 
   the Game class.
 * Write the processVerb(String verb): check that the verb is a known command, 
   and write code that calls moveTo(Player, direction) if the verb is n, s, w, 
   or e. Other commands will be processed after you add treasures to your game.
